Over time, a user's home directory can accumulate large files (e.g., videos, backups, log files) that consume significant disk space. Manually searching for these files can be tedious.
The goal is to create a Bash script that automatically scans the home directory (~) and lists all files larger than 100 MB, along with their sizes and details(ls -lh).
